what is a File?

A named location to store information


steps:

1) Opening
2) Perform operation
3) Closing


f = open("test.txt") #Open file in current directory
f = open("C:/Python33/README.txt") #Specifying full path


'r' - Open a file for reading (default)
'w' - Open a file for writing. Creates a new file if it does not exist or truncates the file if it exist
'x' - Open a file for exclusive creation. If the file already exists, the operation fails
'a' - Open for appending at the end of the file without truncating it. Creates a new file if it does not exist
't' - Open in text mode (default)
'b' - Open in binary mode
'+' - Open a file or updating (reading and writing)

Highly recommend to specify the encoding
f = open("test.txt", mode = 'r' , encoding = 'utf-8')

f = open("test.txt")
f = open("test.txt", 'w')
f = open("img.bmp", 'r+b')

#perform operations
f.close()

#use try

try: 
	f = open("test.txt",encoding = 'utf-8')
	#perform file operations
finally:
	f.close()


With with is not necesary to especify close method
with open("test.txt",encoding = 'utf-8') as f:
	#perform file oprations
